# DDD in PHP Book Issues

Our goal is to make "[Domain-Driven Design in PHP](https://leanpub.com/ddd-in-php)" the best DDD book for PHP developers. In order to archive that, please, use this repository for reporting issues, comments, suggestions, etc. We'll try to answer all of them and fix asap. Thanks in advance.

Happy reading!
